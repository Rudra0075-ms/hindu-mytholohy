      <p>To purify the souls of ancestors, King Bhagiratha performed intense penance. Moved, Lord Brahma agreed to release the celestial river Ganga. But her mighty force could destroy Earth, so Lord Shiva caught her in his locks and gently released her, allowing Ganga to flow safely.</p>

      <p>Goddess Parvati created Ganesha from clay to guard her while she bathed. When Shiva returned and was denied entry, he beheaded Ganesha in anger. Parvati was distraught, so Shiva replaced the head with that of an elephant, giving rise to the beloved god of beginnings and wisdom.</p>
